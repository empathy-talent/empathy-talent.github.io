title: Privacy Policy for Webhook Notifier
permalink: /privacy-policy/
Effective Date: November 5th 2025

Thank you for using Atlas2BC extension (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy is here to help you understand what data our Extension collects, why it collects it, and what it does with that data.

This policy is written to be as clear and straightforward as possible.

Summary for Reviewers & Users
Limited Functionality: The Extension is designed for a specific business purpose: to scrape data from designated pages on my.recruitwithatlas.com and send it to a pre-configured webhook at hook.eu1.make.com.
No User Data Collection: The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about the user (e.g., your name, email address, IP address, or Google account information).
No Browsing History Tracking: The Extension does not track your browsing history. It only activates when you click its icon on a supported page.
Data Handling: All scraped data is sent directly to the specified webhook and is not stored, viewed, or analyzed by the developer of this Extension.
1. Information We Collect
We have designed our Extension to be as privacy-conscious as possible.

A. Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be explicit about the information we do not collect from you:

We do not collect any personal information like your name, email address, phone number, or location.
We do not collect your login credentials for any website.
We do not track your general browsing history across the web.
We do not collect information from your computer, such as your IP address or operating system.
B. Information We DO Access (Webpage Content)

When you click the Extension's icon on a supported URL within my.recruitwithatlas.com, the Extension accesses and reads specific content from that webpage only. This is the sole purpose of the Extension. The data accessed includes:

On Candidate Profile pages: Candidate name, status, role, and owner.
On Project pages: Project details such as client, end client, rate, location, and team.
The URL of the active page to provide context in the webhook payload.
This data is processed ephemerally—it is held in memory only for the brief moment required to send it to the webhook. It is never saved to your computer or transmitted to the developer.

2. How We Use and Share Information
The use and sharing of the information described above is extremely limited.

Sole Purpose: The webpage content is collected for the single purpose of packaging it into a JSON format and transmitting it to a pre-configured, secure webhook URL (https.hook.eu1.make.com/...).
Third-Party Sharing: The only third party this data is shared with is the Make.com (formerly Integromat) automation service, via the webhook URL specified in the Extension's code. This is done to integrate with your organization's internal workflows. You can review their privacy policy at https://www.make.com/en/privacy-notice.
No Developer Access: We, the developers of the Extension, do not have access to, nor do we receive, store, or view, any of the data that you scrape and send to your webhook.
3. Data Security
We take the security of your data seriously.

All data transmitted from the Extension to the webhook is sent over a secure, encrypted HTTPS connection.
The Extension itself does not store any of the scraped data after it has been sent.
The security of the data once it arrives at the Make.com webhook is governed by the security practices of Make.com and the configuration of your specific workflow.
4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
